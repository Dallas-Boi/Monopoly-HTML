<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>This is my second Monopoly game I have coded. The last one wasn't so good because it was very buggy, slow, confusing to fix, and just overall not a good idea to keep supporting it. Monopoly 1.0 Was made in Python and you can find it on my GitHub (It is most likely broken and not launchable by itself). This version of Monopoly has been recorded in a different language from the ground up. I started to code the game back on September 13th, 2023, and Released the first version on October 5th, 2023. This version is not only faster but easier to add new ideas, and because of this I am able to make it more reliable. This all started as a personal project for people at my school so we had something to play in class.</p>

<h2>The Difference Between the Versions</h2>
<p>The difference in between the Game versions is that the Stable version is more stable than the Testing Version. The Testing version is always updated when I push the files from my computer to GitHub. The Stable version is the next update and does not have anything new until the next update that is tested and stable for others to play. The testing version uses the GitHub pages while The Stable version uses CodeHS because this site is not blocked by the school I go to. I used codeHS because it will not be blocked by the county I go to because the Computer Science Classes use this site to code. If there are any problems with the Stable version or if another site that is better for hosting the file becomes available then I will switch to that site if I know that the county will not block it.</p>
