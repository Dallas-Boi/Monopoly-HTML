<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>This is my second Monopoly game I have coded. The last one wasn't so good because it was very buggy, slow, confusing to fix, and just overall not a good Idea to keep supporting it. Monopoly 1.0 Was made in python and you can find it on my github (It is most likely broken and not launchable by itself). This version of Monopoly has been recoded in a different language from the ground up. I started to code the game back on September 13th, 2023 and Released the first version on October 5th, 2023. This version is not only faster but easier to add new ideas, because of this I am able to make it more relieable. This all started for a personal project for people at my school so we had something to play in class.</p>
